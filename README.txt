OVERVIEW : GIFT GENERATOR

I am going to make a gift generator based on a few simple questions. 

Assisted: This will be the order form part. Generating a request based on a users input.
Unassisted: I will then add another layer where the generator will show a different gift based on what the user input was.

EPIC: Create a gift generation request form.

User Story: User wants to buy an appropriate gift based on age and gender.

( ) Figure out what the variables are. (Age, Sex)
( ) Write function that will display the chosen values within a request.
( ) 

Planning for assisted: 
- I plan on using the sandwich builder and modifying it to suit my needs.

Planning for unassisted: 
- I want to use an "if else statement" to display the right pictures linked to the var values chosen by the user.
